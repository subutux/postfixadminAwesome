  Recreating a superadmin account


When you run setup.php you will be required to enter a super user name and password. 
This user will be able to login and modify any domain or setting. Hence, superadmin!.

With that login you can create new superadmins (and you should delete or change the
password of  admin@domain.tld). If that user is no longer there or you didn't use
the .TXT files, you could add another manually from the database. 

(The example uses MySQL, the syntax will be similar for PostgreSQL)

# mysql 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g. 
Your MySQL connection id is 8186 to server version: 5.0.27 
 
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer. 
 
mysql> use postfix 
Reading table information for completion of table and column names 
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A 
 
Database changed 
mysql> INSERT INTO domain_admins (username, domain, active) VALUES ('new@domain.tld','ALL','1'); 
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) 
 
mysql> INSERT INTO admin (username, password, active) VALUES ('new@domain.tld','$1$0fec9189$bgI6ncWrldPOsXnkUBIjl1','1'); 
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) 
 
mysql> exit 
Bye 
 
Then you can log in as new@domain.tld, password: admin 


(The domain 'ALL' should already exist in the domain table; if not you'll need to recreate it)
