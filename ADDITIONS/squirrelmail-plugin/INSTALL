Installing the postfixadmin Plugin
======================================

Requirements:
=============

 - PHP 5.2.x with php5-xmlrpc installed (if available; it should be available by default anyway)
 - http access to a local/remote postfixadmin interface
 - Zend Framework - download from http://framework.zend.com 
    - the Zend directory needs to be in PHP's include_path, or in the same directory 
      as the plugin. Suggested version 1.10; older versions should work.

Installation :
==============

- Check out this code (svn co http://squirrelmail-postfixadmin.palepurple.co.uk/svn/trunk postfixadmin) 
  into the Squirrelmail plugins directory.

- Edit config.php and specify the remote URL for the Postfixadmin XmlRpc service. There isn't much more to change.

- Edit the remote Postfixadmin's XmlRpc service config file and ensure 'xmlrpc_enable' is set to boolean true.

- Enable the plugin through 'squirrelmail-configure' or 'config/conf.pl'.  
   Choose option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.


Security :
==========

- The XmlRpc client needs to get the user's mailbox password before it will be able to connect to the
  XmlRpc server (postfixadmin). The plugin prompts the user for their mailbox password, and caches it in their session
  ($_SESSION['password']). This password is then sent once on every page load to the remote XmlRpc server.

- You should consider doing any of the following :

 - Using https if the server and client are on seperate servers. This will probably require a signed certificate etc, and may require changes to the Zend_XmlRpc_Client's HttpClient.
 - Using something like stunnel to encrypt traffic between server(s).
